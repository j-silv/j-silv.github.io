After receiving my chemistry bachelorâ€™s in 2019, I went through a reorientation to pursue my hobby of electronics. In 2022, I obtained a master's degree in electrical engineering at the University of Strasbourg in France. After finishing school, I moved to the Bay Area in February 2023 and started my career at Texas Instruments.

While at the company, I've worked on various software-related projects in the semiconductor space, and quickly discovered a passion for machine learning applications. I hope to leverage my unique interdisciplinary background to target biomedical and medicinal deep learning applications.

In my free time, I like to work on personal software and electronics projects ranging from AI voice cloning software to FPGA-based Sudoku devices. These endeavors can be found on this website and on my GitHub page.
